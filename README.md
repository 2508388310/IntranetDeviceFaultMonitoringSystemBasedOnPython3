This is my graduation thesis. word,ppt and presentation video are all in the explanatory file.



For me, this paper only learned the application of various functions and frameworks, however, the standard naming, algorithm, and code cleanliness are not very good.

Big projects have given me a new appreciation for teamwork, project construction, although I have taken some courses that have helped make code cleaner, UML design, etc.

But the application of this project is also a mess.

My future employment direction may not be software engineering, but I still hope that you can give me learning suggestions, especially in the aspect of project multi-member collaboration.

Thank you

这是我的毕业论文，论文word,ppt,演示视频都在说明文件中。



对于我来说，本次论文只是学习到了各种函数和框架的运用，然而，规范命名，算法，代码整洁做的不是很好。

大的项目让我对团队协作，项目构建有了新的认识，虽然我学了一些有益于代码更加整洁的课程，UML设计等。

但是在本项目应用时也是一团糟。

我未来的就业方向可能不是软件工程，但依旧希望各位从业大佬给出学习建议，尤其是项目多人协作方面。

感谢
